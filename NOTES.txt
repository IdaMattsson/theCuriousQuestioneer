NOTES:


readln() will parse an input sentence into a list of words.

UPDATED TODO 1:

1. figure out special characters ',' and '?' - IDA - have gotten some to work, and formattet output. Not complete yet. 
2. how to handle 'incorrect' input / other forms of input (for example "Can you dance?" "that’s already a question' or something like that - take input subject, and say no X inv_verb. 
3. get rid of assumptions - esp. being able to parse 'I like oranges' -> don’t I? - (looking at adding 'hidden auxiliary verb') - JUSTIN, assume that the subject and verb agree.
3. tense and subject-verb agreement - IDA

3. making sure everything is commented

Classify input nouns 



TODO

1. Add more information to the database
2. Create rules for the questions, start with tag questions, then move on to more involved examples
3. Possible in-depth: abstract away from a specific dictionary, but base question generation off of the type of input word. 
4. Possible in-depth: Add more question structures

personal statements;

I like oranges
I like oranges, don’t I?

or do we want to change the input to an interrogative sentence, like:

I like oranges:
You like oranges, don’t you? 



// Is there a way to reverse readline so the output looks more natural?
