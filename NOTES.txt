NOTES:


readln() will parse an input sentence into a list of words.

UPDATED TODO 1:

1. SAV - done
2. SV - done
3. 'be'
4. -ing form
5. possibly other forms of input, eg 'the cute cat is dancing’ (det and adj)




TODO

1. Add more information to the database
2. Create rules for the questions, start with tag questions, then move on to more involved examples
3. Possible in-depth: abstract away from a specific dictionary, but base question generation off of the type of input word. 
4. Possible in-depth: Add more question structures

personal statements;

I like oranges
I like oranges, don’t I?

or do we want to change the input to an interrogative sentence, like:

I like oranges:
You like oranges, don’t you? 



// Is there a way to reverse readline so the output looks more natural?
