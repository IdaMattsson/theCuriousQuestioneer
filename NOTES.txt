NOTES:


readln() will parse an input sentence into a list of words.


TODO

1. Add more information to the database
2. Create rules for the questions, start with tag questions, then move on to more involved examples
3. Possible in-depth: abstract away from a specific dictionary, but base question generation off of the type of input word. 
4. Possible in-depth: Add more question structures
